This exercise focuses on extracting and visualizing neural network representations using the **MNIST** dataset.

Key steps include:

- Training a small **MLP** with three hidden layers.
- Extracting hidden layer outputs.
- Projecting those representations into 2D using **UMAP** or **T-SNE**.
- Monitoring how the learned representations evolve over training.

The project provides insight into the learning dynamics of neural networks and highlights generalization by comparing train/test projection differences.
