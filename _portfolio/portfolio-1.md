This project introduces **BayesianFlow**, an approach for estimating pixel-wise uncertainty in generated images. It extends the principles of _BayesDiff_ to the more efficient **Flow Matching** generative models.
We leverage the **Last Layer Laplace Approximation** to quantify uncertainty during the generative process, providing interpretable uncertainty maps. Experiments on **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** demonstrate the method's effectiveness.
