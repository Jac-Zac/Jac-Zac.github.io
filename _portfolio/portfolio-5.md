This project builds a minimal yet powerful **vector store** in Python, enabling **similarity search** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** with the **Mistral** LLM via **Ollama**.

Key features:

- Embedding-based document storage and retrieval
- No need for Langchain or LlamaIndex
- Local setup with simple CLI instructions
- Demonstrated with real research papers

Ideal for learning the core principles behind modern RAG systems.
