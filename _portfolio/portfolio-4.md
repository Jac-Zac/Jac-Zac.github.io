This project performs non-linear analyses of a dynamical system using multiple visual tools.

Included:

- A **Jupyter notebook** for phase diagram analysis.
- Python scripts to create a **numerical GIF**.
- Code for a **Manim animation**.
- A custom **library of solvers**.

Resources such as the _StreamLines_ and _VectorField_ Manim modules are used to bring dynamical behavior to life.
