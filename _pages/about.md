👨🏻‍💻 I'm final year Master's student in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** at the University of Trieste.

🔬 My academic and professional focus lies in anything related to **Deep Learning Theory**, **Interpretability** and **Bayesian Deep Learning**

📚 I recently worked on a project ...

🧠 I'm passionate about research and continually learning more about **AI, machine learning**, and how to apply these tools effectively in the real world.
