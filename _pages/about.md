👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final-year **Master's student in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** at the University of Trieste.

🔬 My academic and professional focus lies in **Deep Learning Theory**, **Mechanistic Interpretability**, and **Bayesian Deep Learning**.

📚 I recently worked on a project applying AI to real-world problems, as well as on projects with a more research- and theory-focused approach

🧠 I'm passionate about research and continually learning more about **AI, machine learning**
